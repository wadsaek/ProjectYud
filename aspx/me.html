        hii!! my name is Esther Barenboim, or as people like to call me - Esthy. I am a young really smart person with a strong enthusiams for physics, maths and music(I play the drums!!). This site mostly encompasses music, so I want to talk a little bit about the story of the project.
        <br /><br />
        I have a sort of a blog to which I sometimes publish so-called Songs of the day. They sometimes have a story behind them but I felt that'd be too much for this project. One day when exploring the possibilities of Telegram and Python 3 I got an idea. I wanted to make a bot which would take these songs and send them to people that have registered. In the end, I succeeded and I honestly love what came out of it, so when it came to the tenth grade project I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do. The finished product feels a lot different from what it looked like in my head those two months ago, but I am really happy with how it turned out.
